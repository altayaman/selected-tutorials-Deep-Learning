This directory contains tutorial files used for an "Advanced TensorFlow" presentation to the Stanford NLP Group.

Files:

- `setup.sh` contains a quick and dirty setup script for using TensorFlow on the NLP cluster (on a `jag` machine).
- `TF internals.ipynb` is a literate code file describing the basics of TensorFlow internals relevant to the typical TF developer.
- `RNN example (language identification).ipynb` is a less-literate code file with an example of a complete RNN model, including training.

Enjoy! Feel free to contribute changes or complain to me directly by creating a GitHub pull request / issue.
